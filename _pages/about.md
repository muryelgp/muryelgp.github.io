I am a forth-year graduate student in the <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu" target="_blank">William H. Miller III Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where I work under the guidance of <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/suvi-gezari/" target="_blank">Suvi Gezari</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of high-energy astrophysics and time-domain astronomy, with a focus on understanding black hole accretion processes in the era of wide-field surveys and rapid multi-wavelength follow-up. I study transient phenomena associated with black holes—such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs)—using wide-field sky surveys and targeted observations spanning from X-rays to the infrared. Additionally, I am also interested in the study of X-ray binaries, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and the search for high redshift transients.

A central theme of my recent work has been the development of new data analysis methodologies that: (i) integrate modern advances in accretion theory into the interpretation of observational datasets, and (ii) enable robust, quantitative testing of theoretical models for these extreme astrophysical phenomena.


Before joining JHU, I earned both my B.Sc. and Master’s degrees in Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://ppgfsc.posgrad.ufsc.br/?lang=en" target="_blank">Federal University of Santa Catarina</a>. My research there focused on galaxy evolution and active galactic nuclei, primarily through optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy observations. I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_NWGzLIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">R. Cid Fernandes</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGfZ3zoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> D. Ruschel-Dutra</a>.
