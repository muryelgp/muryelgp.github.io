My name is Muryel Guolo. I’m a rising third-year graduate student in the [William H. Miller III Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). [Suvi Gezari](https://www.stsci.edu/who-we-are/leadership/suvi-gezari) is my advisor.

I am interested in time-domain astronomy and high-energy astrophysics. I use wide-field sky surveys and targeted multi-wavelength observations to study the physics of nuclear transients, such as tidal disruption events (TDE), quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs), and highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGN).

Before coming to JHU, I obtained my B.Sc. and my Master’s in Physics and Astronomy at the [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ppgfsc.posgrad.ufsc.br/?lang=en), working in AGN and galaxy evolution, advised and in collaboration with [Roberto Cid Fernandes](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_NWGzLIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Daniel Ruschel-Dutra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGfZ3zoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Thaisa Storchi Bergmann](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=-qF-yBUAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).
