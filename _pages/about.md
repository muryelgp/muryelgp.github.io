I am a forth-year graduate student in the <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu" target="_blank">William H. Miller III Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where I work under the guidance of <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/suvi-gezari/" target="_blank">Suvi Gezari</a>.

My research lies in the intersection between high-energy astrophysics and time-domain astronomy, with a focus on understanding black hole accretion processes in the time-domain era. I utilize wide-field sky surveys and targeted multi-wavelength observations to study transient astronomical phenomena associated with black holes, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs). Recently, a key aspect of my work involves developing new data analysis approaches and techniques to test theoretical models for these phenomena. Additionally, I am also interested in the study of X-ray binaries, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and the search for high redshift transients.

Before joining JHU, I earned both my B.Sc. and Masterâ€™s degrees in Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://ppgfsc.posgrad.ufsc.br/?lang=en" target="_blank">Federal University of Santa Catarina</a>. My research there focused on galaxy evolution and active galactic nuclei, primarily through optical spectroscopy, with an emphasis on Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations. I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_NWGzLIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">R. Cid Fernandes</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGfZ3zoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> D. Ruschel-Dutra</a>.
